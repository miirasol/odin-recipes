    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Chicken pieces (often thighs/drumsticks) are marinated in a potent garlic mixture, 
        coated in seasoned flour (sometimes with cornstarch for extra crispness), 
        deep-fried until golden and crispy, then tossed or brushed with a final burst 
        of sautéed minced garlic for maximum flavor.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>½ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves – pounded thin</li>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            In a shallow dish, mix together the garlic powder, pepper, salt, paprika, bread crumbs and flour. In a separate dish, whisk together the milk and egg.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the oil in an electric skillet set to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Dip the chicken into the egg and milk, then dredge in the dry ingredients until evenly coated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fry chicken in the hot oil for about 5 minutes per side, or until the chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Remove from the oil with a slotted spatula, and serve.
        </li>
    </ol>
