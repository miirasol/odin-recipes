    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A soft, fluffy steamed yeast bun filled with a savory mixture (commonly braised pork belly [Asado] or chicken/beef with hard-boiled egg [Bola-Bola]), encased in dough, proofed, and cooked by steaming until light and pillowy.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup lukewarm water</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix flour, sugar, salt, and yeast together in a large bowl. Add water and 1/4 cup oil; mix into a dough. Knead until smooth and elastic, at least 10 minutes. Dust with extra flour if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            Warm up the oven for 1 minute. Turn oven off.
        </li>
        <li>
            Oil a large bowl; place dough inside and cover with cheesecloth. Place in the warmed oven until size has doubled, about 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Punch down dough. Keep in the oven until risen, at least 15 minutes more. Knead dough onto a flat work surface and divide into 12 golf-sized balls. Roll out each ball and fill with choice of filling (see footnote for my chicken and pork filling). Gather and twist the edges together to secure the filling.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place each siopao on a 3x3-inch piece of wax paper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place siopao in a steamer and steam for 30 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
